# Threejs Sketches

I like making threejs sketches and showing them to people on the internet, but there was no one place where I can collect them all.

So, here I present to you all my dumping ground for threejs sketches.

This project is made using typescript. But the sketches use a lot of glsl as well. 

### The current few sketches are:
